# Senior Software Developer - Join our growing team!

Kent and Medway NHS & Social Care Partnership Trust (KMPT), are seeking talented developers to join their Software Development Team.

Each position offers the opportunity to be involved with building new platforms using the latest technologies; in a team that has the freedom to innovate with their system designs and implementations.

The team has grown rapidly from just 2 to 9 in the last 10 months. Experience with development in the NHS in not a requirement, so if you've never worked for the NHS before then here is a great opportunity.

The in-house software development continues to benefit the Trust - so the team continues to grow. With investment not just in staff numbers, but also comprehensive  training, infrastructure and supporting software systems.

The role involves working within a small dedicated team, with a ‘can-do’ attitude giving you the opportunity to thrive in environment that offers the responsibility to directly deliver and influence projects; allowing you to demonstrate your desire to make a positive and tangible impact.

The team spend time working from home and from our office in Sittingbourne, Kent, and there are opportunities for flexible work patterns. 

The office is directly next to Sittingbourne train station, and is 5 minutes from the M2  with parking on site. If you don't want to be travelling to London each day, then this is a great opportunity.
